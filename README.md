**BRAND PREFERENCE ANALYSIS**

Goal: To find out which of two brands of computers customers prefer, we analyze if customer responses to some survey
questions enable us to predict the answer to a brand preference question.

Data sets:
Train: complete responses survey (10.000 observations from 7 variables) 
Test: 5.000 observations to predict brand preference.

Aproach: **Classification problem developed in R.**

Feature selection: importance of deep analysis on correlation between features.

Algorithms used: **lm, C5.0, KNN, Random Forest.**

Training, testing, metrics, error analysis and predictions for each model.
